**We each have a limitless capacity for greatness, found inside our hearts.**  
What would the world look like if we harnassed all that potential for a greater, more harmonious society <nobr>For All Of Us</nobr>?

I want to live in a world where people are free to discover and be who they truly are, are supported to keep growing and

## That World Is Not Today

We live in a world of turmoil, teetering on the precipice of even greater calamity. All across the political, ideological, spiritual and scientific spectra there are conflicts, fears, and misinformation. People are driven to despondence, apathy, despair—even to committing horrific acts against fellow human beings.

**And I, for one, am tired of it.** I‘m tired of the exploitation of people and resources, I’m tired of our mishandling of our beautiful planet, and I’m tired of the conflict. I want to fight for a better world, but I want to <nobr>Fight With Love</nobr>, not with more violence.

We are a world of broken hearts, but we are not broken people. We still have, within each of us, the capacity to love one another. Every day, millions and millions of people act through a lens of love, to do their part to make ours a better world for everyone. From healing personal traumas, inner conflicts, and undoing the harmful programming of the toxic historical artifects that our society is rife with, to truly listening to others, acknowledging the reality of their feelings, supporting them in their needs, and working towards peaceful collaboration. People are doing the work, but there is more work to be done. More importantly, we need…

## A Different Kind Of Thinking

> We cannot solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them.

What would it look like if we reimagined everything, all of human society, with a lens of love for all people? What if we combine the best knowledge, practices, and wisdom that humanity has accumulated across the thousands of years of civilization—and apply it to healing and repairing the divides between us? Could we eventually solve the monumental challenges our global society faces, together?

I believe we can.

What could humanity accomplish if every single one of us would be respected and accepted for who they are, supported in our needs, and given the opportunity to pursue our wants and live our best lives? Could we evolve humanity to a wider cultural mindset of us and them?

I believe we can.

What if we had tools and support systems for people to heal from their broken hearts and broken dreams at scale, and custom-tailored experiences for each individual or group of people to remove the burdens of shame, cleanse any sources of toxicity, and nurture the wounds of the soul? Could we find redemption and harmony together once more?

I believe we can!

I believe we can build the world of tomorrow on foundations of universal love, a balancing of our own needs with a compassion for the needs of all others, and a conscious practice of the work, the effort, and the feeling into our hearts to overcome all that holds us back. I believe there is…

A Brighter Future For Humanity
We are at the precipice of a revolution of love, a paradigm shift to a new modality of thinking and seeing the world, one informed by a deeper and more complete understanding of Love as a powerful force, going way above and beyond a stronger form of affection or romantic interest. In this exact moment in our time on Earth, we are seeing a major convergence of science, spirituality, ontology, and theology—their teachings and understandings are coming together and aligning in harmony like never before.

One key lesson this convergence has taught is us the following:

What we give our attention to + The way we choose to look at it = Our lived reality
